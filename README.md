This repository contains **my personal, modified build of dwm**, originally from  
[suckless.org](https://dwm.suckless.org/).

The base for this build is taken from:

https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/dwm-titus

That repository was cloned and then **customized and extended** to suit my own
workflow, with additional rules, patches, and configuration changes.
